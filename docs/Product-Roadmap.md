Below is a rough outline of the features that we are targeting for CHEFS. [Post your ideas, leave a comment or vote on what CHEFS features we should build next ](https://chefs-fider.apps.silver.devops.gov.bc.ca/)






<details>
  <summary><strong>VX.X - FUTURE PLANS....(expand)</strong></summary>
  
  * [ ] Integrate with COMS for file uploads and to allow access to attachments via the API
* [ ] Show notes in exported submissions via API (would need to be configurable, so the form owners could allow that or not)
* [ ] Improve the Submissions View (option to view forms in print or form view, so people can print forms with tabs in one print request)
* [ ] Add time to date range parameter for exporting submissions
* [ ] Reviewers can download multiple submissions at once and attach a template permanently
* [ ] Include fields in email notifications (customizable email templates)
* [ ] Custom spatial form component (click the map and the form records the lat/long)
* [ ] Filter list of submissions with the API
* [ ] Customization submission summary dashboard (counts, totals, or averages on charts)
* [ ] View submission versions
* [ ] Auto-save a form during build
* [ ] Virus scan file uploads; possibly then allow public forms to allow file uploads
* [ ] Multi authentication methods (ie both Business BceId and IDIR??)
