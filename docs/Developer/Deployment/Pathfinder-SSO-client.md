CHEFS requires single sign on authentication which is done through the Pathfinder SSO. You require an IDIR account to register. You must first head to this link https://bcgov.github.io/sso-requests and request SSO integration. However, if you’re joining a team then you’ll need to request an invitation from another team member.

Once your SSO integration request is approved, you’ll have the ability to download a JSON file containing your client id and secret labeled as ***resource*** and ***secret***.
