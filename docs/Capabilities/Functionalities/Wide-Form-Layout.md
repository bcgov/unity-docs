This feature works by utilizing whitespace beside the page and dynamically adjusts based on responsive design breakpoints, which are influenced by the screen size of the device. Note that this feature is particularly noticeable for widths similar to 1023px, 1279px, and 1919px compared to 1024px, 1280px, and 1920px, where the layout transitions affect the spacing around the page.
