## To set form access

You can choose from three levels of access for your form – **Public**, **Log-in Required**, and **Specific Team Members**.

Each option comes with its own set of considerations.

**Public (anonymous)**

The public option gives anyone access to your from, whether inside or outside government. 
Choose Public if you want to run an anonymous survey.

Some of the limitations when choosing Public as your access level are:
* The submitted cannot attach file uploads to their submission.
* The submitter cannot save their submission to finish later.
* The submitter cannot share their submission with others before they submit.

**Log-in required**

Requiring a submitter to log in limits your form to anyone with a **BC Services Card**, **Basic BCeID**, **Business BCeID** or **IDIR** username and password. 

Requiring a log in enables several features for submitters. 
Submitters can:
* Save their submission and finish it later.
* Share their submission with colleagues.
* Use workflows.
* Review all their previous submissions. 

Requiring a login has some limitations:
* You can only select one of: BC Services Card, Basic BCeID, Business BCeID or IDIR; you cannot allow multiple.
* Users often find getting a BCeID confusing.

**Specific Team Members**

If you only want a small group of people to access your form, choose **Specific Team Members**. 
To invite team members:

1. Click **My Forms**.
2. From your list of forms, click **Manage** for the form you want to update.
3. Click **Team Management** on the **Manage Form** page.

<!-- **[Back to top](#top)** -->

If you decide to use **Basic BCeID** or **Business BCeID** for your form access, you must notify the Identity Information Management (IDIM) team by email (IDIM.Consulting@gov.bc.ca). They need to know which forms are using the BCeID service and allocate appropriate resources. 
You should provide them the following in your notification:
