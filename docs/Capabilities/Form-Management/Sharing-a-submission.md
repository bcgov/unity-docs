## How to share a submission

The person filling in the form can invite team members to edit it when it is a draft. They invite your team members by clicking the "Manage Team Members" icon.

* The team member needs to have already logged in to CHEFS for you to find them in this search
* The submitter enters the team member's name, email, or username
* The submitter needs to copy the submission URL and send it to their team member(s).

Once the form is submitted, they cannot edit anymore.

## Restricting Access to Form Team Members

By selecting the form setting "Share draft with form team members only", draft submissions can only be shared with those users who have been added to the form team.

You will be presented with an error when attempting to add a non-team user.
