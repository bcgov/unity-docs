## Form structure

A form is made up of components. For example: input fields, checkboxes or text boxes. You can drag and drop these components from the left column onto your form.

# Basic and advanced components

Advanced components have more configuration options than the basic fields (for example: advanced conditional logic). Having JavaScript programming experience will help when trying to take full-advantage of using advanced components.

## Text field

When you drag a text field onto the form you will see this dialog screen.

**Note**: The form builder has specific components for **Email**, **Phone** or **Number** form fields. They look like the standard ‘text’ field, but the validation rules and appearance are slightly different and will help ensure the data you collect is in the right format.

## Save your design

Once you’ve created a form, make sure you save your design. To save your form click on the “Save Design” icon. You can also export / import your design (as a JSON schema) for re-use in another form or by other form designers.

![Save your Design](images/qs19.png)

Once you save the form, you will see this alert banner. You can preview your form or publish the form.

## Managing versions

You can create a new version of your form design, using an existing version as a starting point. You do this by clicking on the plus icon next to an existing version. A new version will be in a 'draft' state until you set it as 'published' using the toggle in the table of versions. You can only have one draft version, but you can delete that to re-start a new one if required.
