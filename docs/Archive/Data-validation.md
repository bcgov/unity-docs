The form designer can define validation rules on a form field. For example, they can set:

* Required fields
* Required format 
* Custom rules

When someone submits a form, validation errors will pop up, informing them their input does not match the validation rules.

## Validating data with an external source

A CHEFS form field can populate or verify data from an external source by connecting through an unsecured API endpoint. You can do this by writing JavaScript in the form field's settings.
