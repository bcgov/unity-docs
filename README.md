# Common Hosted Forms Service - Technical Documentation

Technical documentation repository to be hosted in Backstage.
The main code repo these techdocs refer to is: [https://github.com/bcgov/common-hosted-form-service](https://github.com/bcgov/common-hosted-form-service)  

## Technical Details

- Markdown: format for the files in the `/docs` directory
- GitHub Workflow: runs on repository `push` to publish the documentation to Backstage (can be run manually if needed)

> **NOTE**: _Currently_ the GitHub Action deploys to Backstage dev but does not deploy to Backstage prod. This will be changed once the documentation is ready for use by the community. Look for the logic in `production` in the GitHub Workflow.
